# Cloudflare Pipelines

This is the starter template for Pipelines, which let you ingest real time data streams and load into R2. This template lets you send data from a Cloudflare Worker, to a pipeline.

* Clone this repository to get started with sending data from a Worker to a pipeline.
* Review the [Pipelines developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/) to dive deeper into how Pipelines Works

## Usage

### Create a pipeline
**Visit the [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/getting-started/) for Pipelines for a full guide to creating your first pipeline.**

If you already have a Cloudflare Workers paid account, get started quickly by running this command to create an R2 bucket, and create a pipeline:
```sh
npx wrangler@latest r2 bucket create pipelines-starter-bucket
npx wrangler@latest pipelines create pipeline-starter --r2-bucket pipelines-starter-bucket
```

### Deploy it
You can create a project using this template by using `npm create cloudflare@latest`:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest pipelines-starter -- --template "cloudflare/pipelines-starter"
```

This will automatically clone this repository, install the dependencies, and prompt you to optionally deploy:
